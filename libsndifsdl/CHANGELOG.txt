   Version 0.7.2

   since version 0.7.1.

   Version 0.7.1

 - Fixed missing "override" statments for CFLAGS in Makefiles.
 - Fixed $(DESTDIR) evaluation in config.[default|macports].mk.

   Version 0.7.0
 + 0.7.0 was finished at about Sun Sep 18 08:41:18 CEST 2011.
 + The "libsndifsdl" library has been taken out of fizmo version 0.6 and
   built to form a separate library.

   Version 0.6.1
 + 0.6.1 was finished at about Mon Mar 30 22:15:04 CEST 2009.
 - Implemented new ENABLE_AIFF_FOR_SOUND_SDL variable in config files. This
   allows the sound-sdl-interface to at least play Infocom .snd files when
   no libsndfile is available.

   Version 0.6.0
 + 0.6.0 was finished at about Wed Mar 25 21:47:06 CET 2009.
 + This marks the point for the first public beta release

   Version 0.5.3
 + 0.5.3 was finished at about Wed Mar 11 21:34:59 CET 2009.
 - Re-built SDL-Sound system (implemented sound effect stack, better sound-
   has-finished-detection and many, many fixes).

   Version 0.5.1
 + 0.5.1 was finished at about Di 4 Nov 2008 21:48:29 CET.
 - Implemented SDL-sound-interface. To make SDL work in Mac OS X I've used
   MacPorts to install SDL ("port install libsdl"), on Debian I've been using
  "apt-get install libsdl-sound1.2-dev" (maybe "apt-get install alsa-base
   alsa-utils" is also required).
 - Added "snd2aiff" commandline utility (this was the basis for the first
   sound interface experiments).
