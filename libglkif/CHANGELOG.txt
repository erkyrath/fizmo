   Version 0.1.3
 + 0.1.3 was finished at about (?).
   Merged with Andrew Plotkin's iOS-fizmo implementation: replaced old
  "fizmo_register_ask_user_for_file_function" with "prompt_for_file"
   implementation in "glk_screen_if.c", added quote box support.

   Version 0.1.2
 + 0.1.2 was finished at about Fri Mar 9 21:01:12 CET 2012.
 - Merged zarf's GLK changes into "glk_screen_if.c". The new version 0.1.2
   fixes screen size detection, timed input and adds lowering of the input
   line.
 - Fixed missing $(DESTDIR) variable -- should already have been present
   since version 0.1.1.

   Version 0.1.1
 + 0.1.1 was finished at about Sun Nov 6 22:44:17 CET 2011.
 - Fixed missing "override" statments for CFLAGS in Makefiles.
 - Fixed $(DESTDIR) evaluation in config.[default|macports].mk.
 - Adapted Makefiles and configuration to use standard GNU Makefile variables
   instead of INSTALL_PATH and FIZMO_BIN_DIR.

   Version 0.1.0
 + 0.1.0 was finished at about Sun Sep 18 08:41:18 CEST 2011
 + libglkif was built from code in Andrew Plotkin's github repository. It
   represents an interface translating fizmo's Z-machine output operations
   into GLK-invocations. The current code should be seen as a first
   experimental release. Please note that bug reports should be sent to
  "fizmo@spellbreaker.org" instead of sending them to Andrew Plotkin.
 - The "fizmo-glktermw" frontend relies on libglkif for it's GLK output.
